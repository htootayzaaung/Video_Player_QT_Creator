Open Qt Creator and configure the the.pro file using Qt version: 5.15.22. When you click on run you will get error message saying No videos Found!3. In order to fix this, open the one of the .cpp file right click on it and copy the full path.For example: if you copied the path from the_button.cpp then go to your Projects-> Run-> Command line arguments(CLI) and past the path there.Now your path would look like this:home/cunix/sc21sd/UI/source code/the_button.cppInstead of this you need to modify the CLI to:“home/cunix/sc21sd/UI/source code/videos”4. Now run the project again.5. Now you can see that some button does not have icons in it. In order to fix this, go to the_player.h and find QIcon(containing user directory) and change that directory according to your preference.
